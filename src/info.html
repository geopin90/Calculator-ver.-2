        <h1>SmartCalc v2.0 by cojess</h1>
        <p>developed on C++17 language with QT</p>
        <h2>Review:</h2>
        <p>SmartCalc can handle arithmetic expressions with operands and algebraic functions.</p>
        <p>It works with integers and with floating point numbers.</p>
        <p>Also you can see a plot of some function or polynomial.</p>
        <p>To see a plot you should enter some value including 'x' and then press "PLOT" button, enter the range of x and y on the plot.</p>
        <p>You can enter values by pressing appropriate buttons in the application or just by typing it on the keyboard(as a simple text).</p>
        <p>If you want to make deal with negative numbers(or unary operators), place it in braces, for example: "2+(-1)". Expression "2+-1" will not be correct.</p>
